<h1>Summer Plans</h1>

<h3>What I Already Have Done</h3>

<p>After school ended, I had my dance recital. It was very long and exhausting. We had a dress rehearsal the day before the recital. We always have a barbeque in between the 2 shows of the dress rehearsal. The actual recital day everyone did a great job and the shows went smoothly.</p>

<h3>Plans for Later</h3>

<p>I also have my dance nationals competition later in the summer. It is in Orlando, Florida. It's going to be very hot and I'll get to swim sometimes if I get a break. Before we leave we have a going away party at my studio with water balloons and games.</p>
<p>While I'm in Michigan I will stay tidy and organized. I will walk my dog, go to the pool, and hang out with my friends. It will be nice to relax after nationals and hang out with my friends.</p>
